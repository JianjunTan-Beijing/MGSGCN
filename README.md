# MGSGCN
Prediction of lncRNA-disease associations by graph convolutional network based on multi-graph structures and attention mechanism

The _Code_, _Datasets_ directories contain model codes and tested data sets, respectively. 
The depended python packages are listed in _requirements.txt_. The package versions should be followed by users in their environments to achieve the supposed performance.

## Dependency:

python 3.7.13

## Requirement:

numpy==1.21.6    

matplotlib==3.5.3    

torch==1.6.0+cu102    

torch-geometric==1.6.1   

networkx==2.6.3    

pandas==1.3.5    

scipy ==1.7.3    

scikit-learn==0.23.2

## How to run

The program is in Python 3.7.13 using [Pytorch] backends. Use the below bash command to run MGSGCN.

```bash
    python Main.py -d dataset
```
